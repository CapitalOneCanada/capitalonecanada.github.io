On November 23rd, Capital One hosted its very first Tech Series event with special guest speaker Dan Makoski. The talk focused on how you can take a deeply human designed approach to transform your technology and business in profound directions and provide fantastic experiences to your customers. Using tools such as Playdough and paper, Dan engaged the audience in exercises that helped to illustrate how a more human approach to design can enable you to see other ways to solve problems. The talk was a smashing success, with more than 70 people from the Toronto tech community attending and helping to support Ladies Learning Code through their generous donations.

Capital One is excited to be planning more of these events in 2016, so keep watching this space for more details on how you can join us!
