I love Fall... leafs change color, our oppressive DC humidity becomes tolerable and best of all: Hackathon season kicks back up.

Each year, approximately 50,000 students participate in a variety of college hackathons -- and as an employer that always keeps an eye out for the brightest up and coming talent, these events tend to be some of the best places to look.

We’re currently planning to send the team out to 17 of our favorite events.  If you’re a student attending one of these events be sure to come by the Capital One booth to meet the team, get some mentoring help with your project, or better yet give our API "Nessie" a spin (as seen on DevPost.com as one of their top trending API’s and Technologies seen on campus).
