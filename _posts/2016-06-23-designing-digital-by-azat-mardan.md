Node.js is fast and scalable web-oriented non-blocking I/O built on top of Google Chrome V8 engine. Almost every web developer uses Node or Node-based tools to some extent. However, Node has some really powerful features worth knowing. On July 12, 2016, join Azat Mardan of Capital One Technology for our next C1 Tech Series event in Toronto as he dives deep into the core mechanisms of the Node.js platform and some of its most interesting features. We’ll review the core concept which enables the non-blocking I/O, and discuss streams, buffers and effective ways to work with data. Then, we'll have a crash course about event emitters and level-up our knowledge on how to fork like a pro. We’ll also discuss AsyncWrap, Domain and uncaughtException. We’ll dive into to the core and you'll learn how to write your own C++ addons. If you’re a geek like most of us, then you’ll appreciate this presentation. You’ll become more confident in the internals of Node.js and understand how certain things work.

Donations will be collected for the [OneWalk to Conquer Cancer](http://to16.onewalk.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=to16_homepage) benefiting Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. On September 10, thousands of walkers – including cancer survivors and their supporters – will walk 25km across Toronto to drive awareness and increase fundraising for cancer research.

Food and drinks will be provided.
