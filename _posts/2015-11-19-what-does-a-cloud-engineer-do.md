## A Day in the Life of a Cloud Engineer

There’s a new era of software development on the horizon. As a Cloud Engineer at Capital One, I’m excited to be standing on the cusp of so much change. In the Capital One Engineering Department we eat, breathe, and live tech, and as part of the College Hire program, I’m continually exposed to some of the brightest young engineers sourced from the best schools around the country.

In the past few years, I've seen a transformation amongst skilled developers - particularly those who grew up in the age of the Internet – of the way they go about the business of creating software.   The new method they tend to favor is even faster than agile, while maintaining – or even increasing – its degree of flexibility. This is engineering without borders: a way of developing code and proving that the logic behind it works before finalizing the requirements. This new philosophy, which I believe to be future mainstay in software development, centers around three key concepts: 

## 1. Leveraging Cloud infrastructure to create development platforms on demand.
The ability to create, develop, and test with blinding speed is the key factor to this new school of distributed software creation. We are young engineers who grew up loving technology and feel comfortable operating on ephemeral instances in the cloud. We can scale to meet our resource needs on demand, as opposed to working on old school servers we must maintain and update in order to get our work done. The ability to blast away instances and not have to worry about uninstalling programs to free up resources is synonymous with getting things done - Fast.

## 2. Creating the core logic first and letting the requirements follow.
I get it. Companies need to plan, leadership needs to forecast, and metrics have to be generated every week and quarter. But the need to look ahead can also get in the way with the day-to-day business of making software.  What’s the use in Groom and tasking every story, creating dependencies and building a background for a project that might not even pan out the way you want? I think the best way to develop any new concept or idea is to just do it. This applies to companies of any size. From large corporate environments where backlogs are often filled with enhancements and feature requests for a particular application, to a startup that focuses on one core offering, the core principle should be the same.  Writing code and building out requirements after the core logic is proven valid is the key to increasing efficiency beyond the speed of agile. It all boils down to a simple message: Move past the bureaucracy. Being you is the best philosophy for success.

## 3. Flexibility beyond Agile, while looking down from the top of the waterfall.
In order to develop logic before requirements, we must start from a solid understanding of the project at hand and its relation to the higher-level goals of a given business unit. This kind of lateral thinking is something that Generation Y is no stranger to. For those who grew up in the age of the Internet, understanding and adapting to the latest trends, whether it’s YouTube celebrities to hipster fashion, is a part of daily life. When life moves at such a fast pace, adapting fast is the only way to succeed. As we start migrating from college gigs to the corporate office, we maintain the ability to see beyond the moment and understand the big picture. Whether they’re developing prototypes or simply trying out a new approach, engineers should always think from the perspective of the project’s stakeholders. By understanding the agenda of the company as a whole, we are able to adapt our logic to best address the needs of the task, while creating opportunities for seamless integration with individual business requirements and for fine-tuning with stakeholder expectations afterwards.

## Towards a new evolution in software development 
In the fast-moving media and technology climate we’re currently living in, the key to success is staying one step ahead of your competitors. The need to move at a greater velocity than you ever imagined possible can be intimidating, but adhering to the three key concepts discussed above can make the transition to working at speed much easier. To all my fellow Gen Y engineers, to those young at heart and mind, and all the rest of us looking ahead, I’d pass on this advice:

Dream big and test your theories. Fail fast and fail frequently. Never be afraid to try new things.
