Infrastructure. It takes too long to build. It's expensive. It's hard to manage. It's inflexible. It gets in the way of innovation. <!--more-->

Not here. 

Here at Capital One, you won’t find a traditional bank IT department, and you won't find traditional ways of thinking about infrastructure. In fact, you won’t find an IT department at all. Instead, you’ll find top technologists who are unlocking the potential of infrastructure to help us create great digital experiences for our customers.

My team is charged with harnessing new technology so that our infrastructure can be an incubator for innovation, an accelerator to bring new capabilities to our customers, a trailblazer creating system that allow us to nimbly adapt to demand, and armor protecting our systems and data. Cloud is central to how we are doing that. Attending conferences like, [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/), which took place in early October, are a chance for me to find out how others are using AWS and the Cloud to fuel innovation, raise the bar on quality, lower cost, and raise performance. It’s also a chance to share how Capital One is building a robust infrastructure, enabling self-service access, and hiring the best talent in the field.

## Fostering a Robust Infrastructure
To keep our digital servicing channels "always on" for our customers, we need plenty of capacity that can expand and grow in tandem with our needs, as well as provide resiliency for when individual components fail.  Over the years, we’ve weighed the tradeoffs of carrying backup components and consistently lean towards having extra equipment provisioned ahead of any incident so that outages are eliminated or minimized. The elasticity and availability of the Cloud is a game changer for us. No longer will we have to build and maintain a stadium for Super Bowl Sunday. Or put in the language of our business, no longer will we have to build a data center for Cyber Monday. 

## Enabling Self-Service
One of the consistent themes in our business is a belief in enabling our talent to be self-sufficient.  It's not enough to provide access to infrastructure: you have to also grant access to the tooling that enables it. An organization of our size has numerous agile teams spread across multiple geographic regions and business units.  With this level of scale and diversity, we must seize every opportunity to automate our infrastructure, break up silos, clear bottlenecks, and drive to instantaneous fulfillment. This empowers associates and improves our productivity and throughput on a structural level.

## Hiring Great Engineering Talent
Years ago, we saw a tremendous need for engineers with specialized skills tailored to various powerful hardware solutions developed by industry leaders to meet specific technological demands. More recently, we witnessed another industry shift towards virtualization, with new companies quickly gaining share with proprietary hypervisors and other administrative tools.  Today, we're seeing the most efficient models move to the Cloud, where location is largely irrelevant, and capacity can be provisioned on-demand.

From hardware to virtual to cloud-based solutions, what has produced the most success in all of these models is having the top talent required to implement and innovate on these systems.  One certainty in our industry is that whatever we’re working on now will eventually be replaced by something new - probably soon. As we leverage more open-source frameworks, this innovation cycle has increased in speed, requiring continuous learning and skill expansion by our engineers. It’s easy to see why we need this level of talent, but it’s not so easy to actually find!

## Want to learn more?
Are you interested in the challenges discussed above? In building infrastructures that are robust, self-service, and aligned with the current speed and trends of the innovation cycle?  We're hiring engineers to help us leverage technologies like the Cloud, Docker, and Chef to build the infrastructure that gets delivered across Capital One.
