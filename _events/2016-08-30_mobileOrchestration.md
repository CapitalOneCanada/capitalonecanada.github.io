Mobile applications are becoming the primary touchpoint for many consumers. With millions of customers interacting with Capital One mobile apps, it’s imperative that we provide a consistent and outstanding experience.   
Join us for our next C1 Tech Series event in Toronto and learn about new tools impacting architecture decisions in creating robust, scalable, and resilient micro experiences using Netflix Open Source Software such as Zuul, Hysterix, and Eureka. We’ll also walk through the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CICD) pipeline to deploy an Android app to the Play Store using tools such as Fastlane.

Donations will be collected for the Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation’s <a href="http://to16.onewalk.ca/site/PageServer?pagename=to16_homepage" target="_blank">OneWalk to Conquer Cancer</a>. On September 10, thousands of walkers – including cancer survivors and their supporters – will walk 25 km across Toronto to drive awareness and increase fundraising for cancer research.

Food and drinks will be provided.
