Natasha is a Senior iOS Engineer at Capital One in San Francisco and secretly a Robot. She is a Swift and Apple Watch enthusiast who writes about her experiences with this rapidly developing technology on [natashatherobot.com](http://natashatherobot.com/) and in [her weekly Swift newsletter](http://swiftnews.curated.co/). In her free time, she works on personal projects, speaks at meetups and conferences, contributes to open source, and likes to cross things off her bucket list. The last item she crossed off was hiking on a glacier in Iceland.
